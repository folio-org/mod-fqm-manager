// Indicates if mod-finance-storage is installed in the tenant, for use when querying exchange rates
// We do this via API, however, it needs to be used as a condition for if the exchange rates ET can exist
// Unfortunately, mod-finance does not itself have a database schema at all, but mod-finance-storage _should_
// be a sufficient indicator. `app-acquisitions` specifies both together, so there should be no reason that
// only the storage module would exist alone.
