# Entity type creator

This is a tool to assist in the creation of entity types for the `mod-fqm-manager`.

## Getting Started

First, install [Bun](https://bun.sh/). You may be able to use `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm` instead, however, nothing is guaranteed.

Then, install the modules:

```bash
bun install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Although not strictly necessary to run the application, it is **highly** recommended to connect the tool to a running instance of the `mod-fqm-manager` and database. Without these, many features may be disabled.
